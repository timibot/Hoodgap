## What is HoodGap?

HoodGap is a decentralized insurance protocol that lets stock investors hedge against **weekend gap risk** — the price difference between Friday's close and Monday's open.

| Role | What you do | What you earn |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Policy Buyer** | Pay a premium to insure your position | Receive full coverage payout if the gap exceeds your threshold |
| **Staker** | Provide USDC liquidity to the pool | Earn 93% of all premiums collected |
| **Guardian** | Approve weekly settlements, manage splits | Ensures protocol operates correctly |

### How It Works

```
Friday 4pm    → Oracle records Tesla closing price
Weekend       → Users buy gap insurance policies  
Monday 9:30am → Oracle updates with opening price
Monday+       → Policies settle: gap ≥ threshold = payout
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18
- MetaMask or any Web3 wallet
- Hardhat

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your private key and RPC URL
```

### 3. Local Development

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start local blockchain
npm run node

# Terminal 2: Deploy contracts
npm run deploy:local

# Terminal 3: Seed the pool with test liquidity
npx hardhat run scripts/seed-liquidity.js --network localhost

# Terminal 4: Start frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### 4. Run the Full Demo (localhost)

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/demo-lifecycle.js --network localhost
```

This time-travel demo walks through the complete lifecycle:
1. Deploy & seed pool with $100k USDC
2. Buy a $500 gap insurance policy (5% threshold)
3. Fast-forward to Monday with a simulated 8% gap
4. Settle the policy → full coverage payout
5. Staker withdraws remaining balance

### 5. Testnet Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Robinhood Chain Testnet
npm run deploy:testnet

# Verify contracts on explorer
npx hardhat run scripts/verify.js --network robinhoodTestnet
```

## Smart Contract API

### Core Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `stake(amount)` | Deposit USDC into the insurance pool |
| `requestWithdrawal(amount)` | Queue a withdrawal (instant if liquidity available) |
| `buyPolicy(coverage, threshold)` | Purchase gap insurance |
| `settlePolicy(policyId)` | Settle a policy after Monday open |
| `calculatePremium(coverage)` | View estimated premium for given coverage |

### Guardian Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `approveSettlement(week, splitRatio, reason)` | Approve weekly settlement |
| `queueVolatilityChange(newVol, reason)` | Queue volatility update (24h timelock) |
| `queueHolidayMultiplier(week, multiplier, reason)` | Queue holiday override (24h timelock) |
| `pause() / unpause()` | Emergency protocol controls |

### View Functions

| Function | Returns |
|----------|---------|
| `getPoolStats()` | totalStaked, totalCoverage, utilization, reserve, policyCount |
| `canSettle(week)` | allowed, splitRatio, reason |
| `canBuyPolicy(user, coverage, threshold)` | canBuy, reason, estimatedPremium |
| `getQueueStats()` | head, length, pending, dollarAhead, freeLiquidity |

## Premium Pricing Model

```
Premium = Base × Utilization × Volatility × Time Decay

Where:
  Base        = Coverage × 10% (annual base rate)
  Utilization = 1 + U²  (quadratic curve)
  Volatility  = σ_current / σ_average
  Time Decay  = 1 + (1.5% × hours since Friday close)
```

Premiums are bounded: **1% floor** to **95% ceiling** of coverage.

See [docs/MATHEMATICAL_MODEL.md](docs/MATHEMATICAL_MODEL.md) for complete derivations, worked examples, and calibration data.

## Network Configuration

| Network | Chain ID | RPC |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Hardhat Local | 31337 | `http://127.0.0.1:8545` |
| Robinhood Testnet | 46630 | `https://rpc.testnet.chain.robinhood.com` |

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npm test

# Run specific test suite
npx hardhat test test/unit/PremiumCalculation.test.js
```

## Security

- **ReentrancyGuard** on all state-changing functions
- **24-hour timelocks** on guardian parameter changes
- **48-hour failsafe** auto-approves settlement if guardian is unresponsive
- **Oracle staleness checks** (1h for policy purchase, 24h for premium calc)
- **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern throughout

See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for full threat model.
